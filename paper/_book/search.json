    "text": "2.1 Individual and contextual factors\nFamily social status remains a crucial determinant of students’ digital knowledge and abilities. Recent studies demonstrate that children from higher socio-economic backgrounds benefit from greater access to digital devices, high-speed internet, and supportive home environments, which collectively foster the development of digital skills (siddiq_digital_2021?; ghosh_digital_2022?). These families are more likely to provide educational resources, parental guidance, and opportunities for informal digital learning, further enhancing digital literacy (gui_digital_2023?). In contrast, students from lower socio-economic backgrounds often encounter barriers such as limited access to technology and less parental support, which restrict their opportunities to acquire and practice digital competencies (vandenbulck_digital_2022?). This persistent disparity in access and support perpetuates broader social inequalities, as digital skills are increasingly vital for educational success and participation in the digital economy.\nGender is a significant factor influencing digital literacy, though recent evidence suggests the nature of this relationship is evolving. While earlier studies often reported that boys held an advantage in digital skills, more recent cross-national research finds that gender gaps are narrowing or even reversing, with girls in some contexts outperforming boys in digital literacy assessments (siddiq_gender_2016?; gui_digital_2023?). Girls tend to excel in competencies related to information management, communication, and safe online behavior, whereas boys may show strengths in technical or gaming-related domains (ghosh_digital_2022?). These patterns are shaped by socialization processes, cultural expectations, and differential access to digital resources at home and school. Importantly, the extent of gender differences in digital literacy is influenced by broader societal gender norms and policies, suggesting that both individual and contextual factors must be considered to understand and address gender disparities in digital skills development (gui_digital_2023?; ghosh_digital_2022?).\nDigital self-efficacy (DSE) is increasingly recognized as a key predictor of students’ digital literacy. Students who believe in their ability to effectively use digital technologies are more likely to engage with digital tools, explore new applications, and persist in overcoming challenges (siddiq_digital_2021?; tsai_development_2018?). Higher DSE is associated with greater confidence in navigating online environments, which translates into improved digital skills and learning outcomes (hatlevik_students_2015?). Furthermore, the frequency and diversity of online learning-related tasks performed at school—such as collaborating on digital platforms, conducting research, or submitting assignments electronically—provide students with practical opportunities to develop and refine their digital competencies (ghosh_digital_2022?; fraillon_icils_2019?). Empirical evidence suggests that students who regularly participate in such activities demonstrate higher levels of digital literacy, as these experiences foster both technical proficiency and critical thinking skills necessary for effective digital engagement (fraillon_icils_2019?; tsai_development_2018?). Thus, both DSE and exposure to online learning tasks at school serve as important mechanisms through which educational environments can help bridge digital skill gaps.",

    "text": "2.2 Country level factors\nCross-national differences in digital literacy are shaped by a range of country-level factors, including economic development, national digital infrastructure, educational investment, and gender equality indicators. First, countries with higher Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita tend to provide better access to digital resources, both at home and in schools, which facilitates the acquisition of digital skills among students. Economic prosperity enables greater investment in educational technology, teacher training, and digital learning environments, thereby supporting higher average digital literacy scores (siddiq_digital_2021?).\nSecond, the quality and reach of national digital infrastructure—such as broadband internet penetration, device availability, and connectivity in schools—play a critical role in enabling students to engage with digital tools and resources. Countries with advanced digital infrastructure offer more equitable opportunities for students to develop digital competencies, while those with limited infrastructure may exacerbate existing inequalities (fraillon_icils_2019?). Investments in national ICT infrastructure are thus essential for fostering digital inclusion and supporting effective digital learning.\nThird, the level of educational investment—often measured as the share of national GDP allocated to education—directly impacts the resources available for schools, teacher professional development, and the integration of digital technologies into curricula. Higher educational investment can reduce disparities in access to digital tools and support the implementation of digital literacy programs, thereby improving overall student outcomes and narrowing digital divides.\nFourth, gender equality at the societal level can influence the extent of gender gaps in digital literacy. In countries with higher gender equality—measured by indicators such as the Global Gender Gap Index or female labor force participation—girls are more likely to access digital resources and receive encouragement to develop digital skills. These contexts may see narrower or even reversed gender gaps in digital literacy, as supportive policies and cultural norms promote equal opportunities for both boys and girls (gui_digital_2023?). Conversely, in countries with persistent gender disparities, girls may face additional barriers to digital engagement, resulting in lower digital literacy outcomes.\n(tomasurzuam? revisar programa IRC Rome, temas ICILS, para actualizar referencias de esto)",
