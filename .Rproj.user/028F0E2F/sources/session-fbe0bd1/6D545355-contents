# Methods

The present study uses the database from the 2023 cycle of
International Computer and Information Literacy
Study (N = 135), which was applied in 35 countries. The unique feature of this database is that, for
each country where the study was implemented, there are three types of
data files for three established levels: school level,
teacher level, and student level. 

After the data processing, final database is conformed by 94.704 students nested in 31 countries. Oman, Taiwan, Kosovo and Germany Westfalia were excluded due to have missing information about country level variables. 

The first model contains the individual level variables. Their ecuation is the following: 

$$\text{digital_lit}_{i} = \gamma_{10} \text{parents_education}_i + \gamma_{20} \text{books_home}_i + \gamma_{30} \text{sex}_i + \gamma_{40} \text{school_ict_learning}_i + r_{i}$$

The second model manage the country level variables:

$$\text{digital_lit}_{i} =  + \gamma_{01} \text{PIB}_{ij} + \gamma_{02} \text{gender_inequalities}_{ij} + \gamma_{03} \text{PIB_education}_{ij} + \gamma_{04} \text{e-government}_{ij} + r_{ij}$$ 

From the two equations above, the complete equation for the multilevel model can be derived:

$$\text{digital_lit}_{i} = \gamma_{10} \text{parents_education}_i + \gamma_{20} \text{books_home}_i + \gamma_{30} \text{sex}_i + \gamma_{40} \text{school_ict_learning}_i + \gamma_{01} \text{PIB}_{ij} + \gamma_{02} \text{gender_inequalities}_{ij} + \gamma_{03} \text{PIB_education}_{ij} + \gamma_{04} \text{e-government}_{ij} + r_{ij}$$
